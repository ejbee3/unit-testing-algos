# unit-testing-algos


- I am going to try and work through as many of the 100 algos on his Github [repo](https://github.com/PizzaPokerGuy/100AlgorithmsChallenge) as possible.

- I want to make decent test cases based on his restraints and maybe a few of my own.

- I noticed he's using Typescript for his challenges, so I'd like to figure out how to use Deno.js and Jasmine all in the same suite to import modules. My current set up I just paste the HTML path into the browser and run the tests that way.
